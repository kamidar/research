# Devex Research

Welcome to the Devex Research project.
Its main objective is to learn and explore new technologies.

This repository serves various purposes:

- Collect and discuss ideas.
- Record activity and progress on the project.
- Organize work on the project.
- Present obtained results.

## Repository Structure

The content of this repository is structured as follows:

- `ideas/` contains all idea proposals as markdown files (see below for more
  details).
- `local/` is for personal use and should only be pushed to your fork. Use it
  for prototyping, notes or whatever. If it makes sense you can move files over
  to other folders and open a pull request. Therefore it is recommended to keep
  a folder structure similar to the root directory.

## Proposing Ideas

To propose an idea you need to create a document in the folder `ideas/`
containing basic info:

- short description of the idea
- simple bullet list of steps to perform
- expected outcomes and possible results
- involved technologies
- possible follow-up or spin-off projects

The file name should consist of the current date and a short title, e.g.
`2015-08-18-activity-dashboard.md`. To get started just copy the template
file `ideas/TEMPLATE.md`:

```
$ cp ./ideas/TEMPLATE.md ./ideas/2015-08-18-activity-dashboard.md
```

Then open a pull request to discuss this idea with the team. Once accepted
and merged you should create a GitHub issue with the label `idea`, referencing
the original pull requerst and idea document.
