# Idea Proposal: Create a corpus for international development

*We have over a million documents across Devex ranging from profiles to jobs, procurement and organizations.  A central insight that differentiates us from any competitor is a deep understanding of the keywords and keyword relationships that are critical to and unique within development.  The task here is to leverage machine learning to extract those keywords from our documents and organize them in a way that can be useful both within our platform and, more broadly, to the industry.  As a first step, we could focus on one type of keyword: organization name.*

## Expected Outcomes and Possible Results

*As companies lie at the center of our ecosystem -- linking news, awards, people and jobs -- understanding when we see company names can be powerful both for the user experience and for relating this information across the site.*

## Steps & Tasks

*I can't be certain of the tasks but suspect that this falls into the supervised machine learning concept.  There are some interesting ideas in the article below.*

## Topics & Technologies

*R seems a reasonable choice: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25330753/more-efficient-means-of-creating-a-corpus-and-dtm*

## Possible Follow-ups or Spin-offs

*A possible idea here that ties to the concept of accessing external datasets is looking for additional information about orgs by accessing the Dun&Bradsteer or GuideStart API to validate and enhance our data.*`
